                                       Object Oriented Methodology & C++

1. Write a program that defines an inline function containing two arguments first is for
salary of an employee and second is the percent value by which salary is to be
increased. Main program passes these two values to the function and receives
increased salary for printing.


2. Write a program in C + + that includes a class distance, with data members feet and
inch. It should include a constructor with parameters, member function to display the
distance and a friend function add ( ) that adds distances of two objects.


3. Write a program to read records of students with attributes Roll_No, Name, Branch,
Semester and 5 theory marks in M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. Calculate the percentage
of each student and store in its record. Use array of objects to store data and display
them record-wise.


4. Write a program to swap private data of two classes.


5. Write a program to read a string with the help of constructor using dynamic memory
allocation. Then overload < operator to compare their length and display the smaller
string first and larger string second. For eg. If obj1 and obj2 are two objects having a
string then compare by if(obj1<obj2). If condition is true then print string of object
obj1 “is less than” followed by string of object obj2 otherwise vice versa.


6. Create 2-D matrices dynamically using class and multiply them.


7. Declare a class Time having its members as hour, minute and second. Define
functions to read and display the data and add the contents of two objects into third
object like T3 = T1 + T2 where T1, T2 and T3 are objects of class Time.


8. Let class item is having code, qty and rate as data members which are read by the
appropriate functions. Another class product is having code and price as its data
members and its values are obtained by the object of class item like obj1 = obj2;
where obj2 is the object of class item and obj1 is the object of class product.


9. Overload insertion and extraction operator in your program and show the results.


10. Write a program to illustrate the concept of hybrid inheritance.


11. Write a program for performing division. If divisor is zero then take the appropriate
action at run time using the concept of try/catch block.


12. Using the generic programming approach, write a program to sort data of different
data types.


13. Write a program to find the size of a file.


14. Write a program to merge two files into third file using command line arguments.


15. Make a menu driven program to insert, retrieve, update and delete the records of
students in file. Program should be able to update either the complete record or some
of the attributes of the records.
